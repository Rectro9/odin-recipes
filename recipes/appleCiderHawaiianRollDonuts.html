        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12-count) package) Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
            <li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced
                Apple Cider)
            </li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a 
                finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough
                to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider
                mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted
                butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a 
                shallow dish and melt remaining butter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar
                mixture.
            </li>
        </ol>
