This is my first project from The Odin Project curriculum. It is a simple recipe website which consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes pages. 

By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Setting up and working with Git and GitHub
- Writing HTML boilerplates code
- Creating and linking multiple web pages
- Using images and links in HTML
